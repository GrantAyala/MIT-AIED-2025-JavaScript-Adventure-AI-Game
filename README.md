# JavaScript Adventure: AI-Generated Physics Game

**Research Project Presented at the MIT AI & Education Summit 2025**

This repository contains the source code for the **Visual/Physics-Based** variant of the *JavaScript Adventure* educational platform. This project was developed as part of my research titled *"Expanding Access to Computer Science Education Through AI Generated Lessons, Quizzes and Coding Challenges,"* which I presented at the **MIT AI & Education Summit 2025**.

## 📌 Project Overview

**JavaScript Adventure** is an AI-generated, web-based platform designed to teach fundamental JavaScript concepts to beginners.

Unlike standard coding tutorials that rely on static text output, this version of the project utilizes **interactive visual simulations** (specifically, "bouncing balls" and physics interactions) to teach logic. Students write JavaScript code to control visual elements on an HTML5 Canvas, providing immediate, high-fidelity feedback on their code.

### 🔬 Research Context & A/B Testing
This repository represents the **"Gamified Visual"** condition of my study.

In my research, I conducted an A/B test to compare student engagement and learning outcomes between two different types of coding challenges:
1.  **Text-Based Logic (Control):** Pure logic puzzles with text output.
2.  **Visual Physics Game (This Repository):** Interactive challenges involving bouncing balls and graphical manipulation.

This specific version was designed to test the hypothesis that high-fidelity visual feedback increases engagement and retention for novice programmers.

## 🎮 Key Features

* **Visual Coding Challenges:**
    * Includes the signature "Bouncing Balls" challenge where students manipulate physics objects using JavaScript.
    * Code changes result in immediate visual changes (speed, color, trajectory), making abstract concepts concrete.
* **AI-Generated Curriculum:**
    * The entire curriculum structure, lesson text, and the base code for the game engine were generated using Large Language Models (LLMs).
    * Demonstrates how teachers can use AI as a "curriculum developer" to build complex educational tools without manually writing every line of engine code.
* **Scaffolded Modules:**
    * Covers variables, functions, loops, and conditionals through the lens of game development.
    * **Lesson -> Quiz -> Visual Challenge** structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Simulation:** Custom physics logic (generated via LLM)
* **Content Generation:** Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 📊 Research Outcomes

The study involving this platform (n=27) highlighted the potential of AI-generated self-directed learning tools:

* **High Completion Rates:** The platform achieved a 64% completion rate across all units, suggesting that the self-directed format was engaging for students.
* **Reduced Instructor Load:** 89% of users completed the curriculum without requiring instructor intervention.
* **Broad Accessibility:** Beginners with zero prior experience achieved a 75% completion rate, validating the scaffolded approach.
